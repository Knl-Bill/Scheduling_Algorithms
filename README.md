# CPU Scheduling Algorithms Repository

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various CPU scheduling algorithms in C++, including First Come First Serve (FCFS), Non-preemptive Priority, Preemptive Round Robin, Shortest Job First (SJF), and their variations considering arrival time. These algorithms play a crucial role in optimizing the execution of processes in a computer system, contributing to efficient resource utilization and improved system performance.

## Usage

Each `.cpp` file in this repository represents a specific CPU scheduling algorithm implementation. You can compile and run these programs to observe the scheduling behavior and performance characteristics of each algorithm.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Scheduling_Algorithms.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Scheduling_Algorithms
   ```

3. Compile and run the desired algorithm:

   ```bash
   g++ FCFS.cpp -o FCFS
   ./FCFS
   ```

   Replace `FCFS.cpp` with the filename of the algorithm you want to run.
